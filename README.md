# MyWebsite
This is a simple personal website created using HTML and CSS, and hosted locally using XAMPP. The site includes my name, academic background, interests in electronics and embedded systems, and a link to my GitHub profile. It serves as an introductory portfolio and a foundation for future web development projects.
